# ARIES_4-4-4-LED-CUBE
PROJECT IDEA:-
We obtain various decorative and beautiful patterns on a 4*4*4 LED cube. The code for the patterns is written using Arduino
The main purpose that the led cube serves is in the entertainment sector. For all intents and purposes, it is actually a high-tech display. Think of it as a three-dimensional display consisting of 64 pixels (or voxels in this case) which can be used to visualize any sort of animation or graphics. The cube has commercial potential due to its advanced and unparalleled design.
A led cube is like a led screen but it is special as it has 3D.We can think of it as a low resolution display. In normal displays it is normal to stack pixels closer to each other in order for better resolution but the led cube has its limits.
The project is mainly for entertainment purposes, and can be used for decorative purposes in our houses, offices etc. This cube can act as a mood elevator and can divert your mind from stress causing problems for sometime.
